# 🌈 IBM - FE Dynamic Image Slider

This project is a simple yet elegant **Dynamic Image Slider** created as part of the **IBM Front-End Development (FE) program**.  
It showcases smooth image transitions built purely using **HTML** and **CSS**, without any JavaScript involvement.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Dynamic Image Slider** is designed to automatically display a series of images in a continuous loop with seamless sliding transitions.  
It’s lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing — a perfect demonstration of CSS animations and layout capabilities.

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Front-End Web Development** learning path to demonstrate fundamental web design and CSS animation techniques.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The dynamic image slider works entirely through **CSS animations** and **HTML layout**:

### 1. HTML Structure
The `index.html` file contains a parent container (`.slider`) which wraps multiple images inside a child container (`.slides`).

2. CSS Animation Logic

The sliding effect is achieved through the CSS @keyframes animation which continuously translates the .slides container along the X-axis.
This makes the images move smoothly from one to another, looping forever.
You can adjust the animation duration (12s) to make the slider faster or slower.

3. Responsive Design

Each image takes up 100% of the slider width.
By using object-fit: cover; and flexible widths, the slider adapts well to different screen sizes — from desktop to mobile.
